# 📊 Ad Campaign Effectiveness Analysis
This project explores streaming user behavior to identify strategic ad placement timings and evaluate a targeted marketing campaign's performance. Using Python and pandas for data wrangling and visualization, we focus on two key objectives:

🔹 1. Optimal Ad Placement Timing
Analyzed engagement metrics and viewer duration across timestamps to identify the most effective time slots for ad placement. Insights are backed by visual trend analysis and data-driven reasoning.

🔹 2. Campaign Impact Evaluation (Test vs Control Group)
Performed a comparative analysis between test and control user groups to assess the success of a recent ad campaign. Engagement-based KPIs such as viewer duration and interaction rates were used to conclude whether the campaign positively influenced user behavior.
